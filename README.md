# Installation Guide

## Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit, Bookworm)

1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (64-bit) onto an SD card, then insert it into the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and start the Raspberry Pi.

2. Configure a Wi-Fi connection to your local network.

3. Update Raspberry PI OS:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

4. The basic system is ready, now it's time to configure!

## Access Point

1. Check if the interface supports AP (Access Point) mode:
```
nmcli -f WIFI-PROPERTIES device show wlan0
```

The result should be `WIFI-PROPERTIES.AP: yes`.

2. A new configuration for an access point is added via the Network Manager:
```
nmcli dev wifi hotspot ifname wlan0 con-name Hotspot ssid "Dogtrailer" band bg channel 3 password "dogtrailer"
```

If an error occurs, it is possible that the Network Manager is not managing the WLAN interface or that it is blocked.
```
nmcli device status
```

If `wlan0` says `disconnected` or `unavailable` check if wlan0 is blocked or turned off:

```
shutdown
rfkill list wlan
```

If the result is `Soft blocked: yes` or `Hard blocked: yes`, then:

```
sudo rfkill unblock wifi
nmcli radio wifi on
```

Now you can try to add a connection again.

3. The access point is now available, but it still needs to be configured as a mini router (NAT + DHCP server):

```
nmcli connection modify Hotspot ipv4.method shared ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.1/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1
```

4. After configuration, the `network-manager` service is restarted and the `Hotspot` connection is activated:

```
sudo service network-manager restart
sudo nmcli connection up Hotspot
nmcli connection show
```

## Webserver

1. First, Python including the package manager and web framework must be installed:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-flask
```
